Short non-technical overview

Hello there and welcome to the national trust website, thank you for being a part of us and your continued support. We will be adding a feature to the National Trust website that displays the current weather for each property's location. This implementation aims to help visitors plan their trips better and increase the likelihood of them visiting one of our registered properties. We'll achieve this by using a small piece of JavaScript code that fetches weather data from a reliable source and displays it on the webpage. This solution ensures that no changes are required to the existing website structure, maintaining its integrity while adding useful functionality. The weather feature will be easily visible and accessible at the top of the page for you to see.

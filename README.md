# Good-Growth-National-Trust-Weath

Good Growth Tech Test

Brief

The National Trust would like to have their properties’ information pages (e.g. here) display the weather in that property’s location. Their belief is that this additional information will increase the probability of users visiting a property. They are unable to make any changes to their website other than to add your JavaScript script to their site. In an ideal world they would like this A/B tested to understand the impact your changes make.

Approach

Firstly, I've visited all the links supplied in the tech test. The main ione being the national trust website where I'll be applying my code/script too. I used the website to get familiar with the task set and how the site runs. I also inspected the page to see how the elements are laid out on HTML. This gave me an idea of how the site is structurd and how elements interact with other.

The next step was to create a plan and user flow according to my experience and how I was going to go about the task. After studying the website, I noted what elements reacted with each other and when a particular action or event was triggered.

Initially, I thought this was going to be building a google chrome extension to add onto the website, something I've looked at but not actually built before. However, I realised that I just needed to write the code in a script format to iterate through. On the SOC bootcamp, we experimented with building an weather app using OpenWeather API, so I did have some familiarity with how it was going to be structured.

Challenges

Had to learn how to extract the data from a href rather than finding the data in an element or script tag and use JSON parse to access the properties

Using a website I was unfamiliar with an unable to access the code base for was definately different from how I've made my own projects and come up with solutions. I guess this is typical in the real industry.

Some of the naming conventions of files threw me off and I spent a lot more time than I should of when trying to figure them out.

I had to use google and research a lot of the concepts and old concepts I'd studied during the bootcamp but needed a little bit of a refresher on.

The structure of the API was a little different from what I expected and with no supporting documentation to support me, I had to break it down myself through trial and error.

A/B testing was a complete new concept to me and it was something I had to graps rather than writing tests in the traditional way I know.

Lessons learnt

Definately helped with a refresher on how to use HTML and manipulate the DOM, a lot of this stuff was studied earlier on and quite quickly. It's important to remember how powerful this stuff is and how you can use it everyday.

A/B testing was something new and useful I think I'll definately use again. It was a eye opener to see all the different types of ways that you can test something.

Getting back into using API's within projects and also the way you can create your own endpoint should you need too.

How to write and use scripts, even though it's a concept I'm familiar with writing it this way and using it on a website was quite new.

Extracting data from an element that had an image in was something new.

Reflections

Creating a user flow and plan beforehand really helped me structure this project, scaffholding and breaking it down into steps.

A/B testing concept taught me a lot about how this stuff would apply in industry

Improvements

I spent a lot of time chasing the wrong stuff through trial and error, it was a huge learning curve and I'm really happy that I did get to display the weather on the website. It isn't the cleanest way of doing things but I tried to keep within the time parameters set too.

Error handlding took up a lot of time and I had to google a lot of how to get them working how I want I should definately revisit them.

Styling on the page to make the weather information look more appealing.

Obviously, the API isn't live and prints different information every time as it isn't able to check the weather live. It would be great to use a Live API to get the information right.
